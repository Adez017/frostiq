## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Node.js (v14 or higher) - for most subprojects
- Python (if any subproject requires it)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository with submodules**
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yourusername/frostiq.git
   cd frostiq
   ```

   If you've already cloned without submodules:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Set up individual projects**
   Each subproject is independent and has its own setup instructions. Navigate to each project's directory and follow their respective README files:
   
   ```bash
   # Example for BakeryBackend
   cd BakeryBackend
   # Follow README instructions in that directory
   
   # Similarly for other projects
   cd ../bakery
   # Follow README instructions
   ```

### Running the Applications

Each subproject has its own setup and running instructions. Please refer to their respective README files for the most accurate information. Here's a general overview:

#### BakeryBackend

#### Bakery Frontend
```bash
cd bakery
# Check the project's README for specific setup instructions
# Typically involves installing dependencies and starting the development server
# Example (may vary):
